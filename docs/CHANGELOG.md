### Changed
- **UI Standardization**: Unified the styling of Theme Toggle, "Back to Hub" buttons, and Icons across Index, Docs, and View pages.
- **Sidebar Improvements**: Refined Table of Contents with visual hierarchy (tree lines, indentation), direction-aware styling, and a sleek, custom scrollbar.

- **Top Button Revamp**: Transformed "Go to Top" button into a cleaner, circular glassmorphic FAB (42x42px) with FontAwesome arrow icon.
- **Edit Logic**: Improved UX by allowing the "Edit" button to toggle/cancel the editor if clicked while the editor is already open.
- **Icon Standardization**: Migrated remaining view-page icons to FontAwesome (`fas`) to ensuring uniform style and weight across the application.
- **Header Metadata**: Enhanced document header to display file size and last modification date alongside the filename.


### Fixed
- **View Page Edit/Save**: Fixed the "Edit" button selector and rectified backend save logic to support nested document paths.
- **Build System**: Resolved `python-dotenv` build warnings and cleaned up root directory clutter.
- **Workspace Configuration**: Fixed path resolution issues that caused "Workspace not configured" errors.
- **Documentation Link**: Fixed 404 error by correctly routing to the `docs` directory.
- **Port Conflict**: Improved startup reliability by handling previous instances.
- **HTML Stability**: Resolved severe corruption in `view.html`, fixed syntax errors in `docs.html` (malformed braces) and `index.html` (error handling logic).
- **Code Hygiene**: Removed unused Modal CSS and standardized theme toggle implementation across all pages to eliminate warnings.
- **TOC Logic**: Fixed critical bug where TOC position toggle failed on `docs.html` due to conflicting default classes.
- **Visual Alignment**: Resolved spacing and alignment discrepancies in settings submenu toggles.
- **Export Functionality**: Fixed broken PDF/Word export actions in `view.html` by correcting ID selectors and updating icons.
- **JS Stability**: Fixed critical JavaScript syntax error in `view.html` that caused interactive buttons (Edit, Top, Export) to fail.
- **PDF Export**: Fixed clientswide error handling to display alert messages instead of downloading corrupt files when export fails (e.g. missing wkhtmltopdf).
